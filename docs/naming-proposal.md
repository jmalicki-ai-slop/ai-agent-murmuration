# Project Naming Proposal: Horde-Inspired Names

## Executive Summary

After iterative research exploring Greek philosophy, modern literature, and military terminology, the strongest candidates evoke **commanding a horde of AIs** - the visceral imagery of marshaling many agents to accomplish great things.

**Primary Recommendation: `codehorde.ai`** (VERIFIED AVAILABLE via whois)

**Strong Alternatives:**
- `tumen.ai` - Mongol 10,000-warrior unit (VERIFIED AVAILABLE)
- `kurultai.ai` - Mongol great council (VERIFIED AVAILABLE)
- `murmura.ai` - Keeps connection to murmuration (VERIFIED AVAILABLE)

## Why Horde/Military Concepts Work

The project orchestrates swarms of AI agents to accomplish tasks. Military terminology captures:

1. **Scale**: Commanding many units toward a goal
2. **Coordination**: Individual units working as one
3. **Power**: The capability that emerges from organization
4. **Action**: Not passive wisdom, but active accomplishment

Unlike Greek philosophical terms (which sound academic and can have negative associations like "sophistry"), military/horde terms are:
- Direct and memorable
- Action-oriented
- Viscerally powerful
- Unique in the tech space

### 2. TUMEN (Strong Alternative)

**Etymology:**
Tumen (tumén, also tümen) was the largest tactical unit in Mongol military organization - 10,000 warriors. Multiple tumens made up the Mongol army that conquered the largest contiguous land empire in history.

**Why Tumen:**

2. **Democratic undertone**: Many contribute to decisions
3. **Historical depth**: Institution that governed empires
4. **Distinctive**: Extremely unique in tech

**Brand Positioning:**
- "Where AI agents convene"

### 4. MURMURA (Keep the Connection)

**Why Murmura:**
